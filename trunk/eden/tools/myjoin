#
#	AWK script to join pairs of lines
#
#	First it puts in an extra line between each pair;
#	then by changing RS and FS it does the join.
#
#	Run it by typing:
#		myjoin [infile] [outfile]
#
#	where [infile] and [outfile] stand for input & output file names.

awk '{print; if (NR%2 == 0) printf("\n")}' <$1 | \
awk 'BEGIN{RS="";FS="\n"}{print $1,$2}' >$2
