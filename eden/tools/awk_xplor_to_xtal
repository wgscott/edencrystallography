#
#	AWK script to convert an XPLOR-style fcalc file from EDEN's Solve 
#	to .phs form, suitable for using in XtalView. 
#
#	Script skips the (0,0,0) term which causes XtalView to choke
#	and it skips entries with amplitude = 0.
#
#	Run it by typing:
#		awk -f awk_xplor_to_xtal < [infile] > [outfile]
#
#	where [infile] and [outfile] stand for input & output file names.
