* fobs and fcalc files are written according to the Phenix specifications.
  Thanks to Paul Adams.

* Parsing of pdb file input uses the CCP4 specifications.  Thanks to Filipe
  Maia.

* hklread.c: handling the 2 fobs formats (with or w/out phases) cleanly.

* viewutil.c and calls converting to/from View format are removed.

* an error that caused all fcalcs to be written (writefcalc() in hklutil.c),
  instead of those masked in, was corrected.
