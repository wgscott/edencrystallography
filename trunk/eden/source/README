		INFORMATION FOR EDEN V 5.0 USERS	June 22, 2004


On line 88 of the Makefile, you will find the following statement:

DOUBLESWITCH 	= ON

This actuates a switch to ensure that Eden will work always in double
precision (as it has in the past).  If, however, you would like to save 
a lot of memory  - and some time as well - you should REPLACE that line
by:

DOUBLESWITCH 	= OFF

If you then type 

make clean
make

the executable, eden, will work in single precision.

Whenever you change the value of DOUBLESWITCH, you must 'make clean' and
then 'make' to get eden to behave as you want it to.  Note that when you 
type 'make' to prepare eden, the executable will not be moved to some 
other directory.  For the complete process, you should type 'make install'.

There are now clear instructions regarding where to find items; both
the directory where the FFTW 'include' and 'lib' are, as well as the 
directory where you want to install the executable.  Please read the 
Makefile carefully before typing 'make'.  You do NOT have to be an
expert programmer to fill in the information that works for your system.

In the past, you were told to set a global variable EDENHOME.  You
no longer need to do this; the variable will be set for you as part of
the 'make' procedure.
